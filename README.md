# CodingBat Java Solutions

This repository contains my step-by-step Java solutions for **CodingBat** problems.  
All solutions are grouped by category (Warmup, String, Array, Logic, etc.) and organized in a clean folder structure.

The main goals of this repository:
- Improve Java fundamentals
- Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Maintain clean, consistent, readable code
- Build a visible public portfolio

## 📁 Project Structure

codingbat-java/
src/
warmup1/
warmup2/
string1/
string2/
array1/
array2/
logic1/
logic2/
...


Each problem is a separate `.java` file, named using PascalCase:  
**Example:** `SleepIn.java`, `MissingChar.java`, `ArrayCount9.java`

Each file contains:
- The method required by CodingBat
- A JavaDoc-style header with the exercise name
- Optional `main()` for manual testing

---

## 🚀 How to Run

This repository contains plain Java classes.  
To run a solution:

1. Open any file in `src/...`
2. Run the `main()` method in your IDE  
   (GitHub.dev → *No run support*, but works locally or in Codespaces)

Java version recommended: **17 or 21**

## 🧠 Coding Style

- Clean and minimal
- No unnecessary variables
- Prefer early returns
- Use `StringBuilder` when needed
- Use loops or indexing depending on problem type
- Comment only when necessary

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

Later I may add:
- JUnit tests for each solution  
- Benchmarking for performance exercises  
- Refactored or optimized versions  
- A small web viewer for all solutions (optional)
